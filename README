This is my (Flafla2) game engine, Remote2D.  Remote2D aims to borrow a lot of the best features from leading 3D engines, namely Valve's source engine/hammer editor and Unity3D, and put them in an easy to use, 2D environment..

The ultimate goal is to have a 2D Java-based engine that makes it very easy to prototype new games, while still retaining a sense of control.  Minimal core code should be required, and more focus should go into the game itself.
